    <string name="temple_info">
        Phra Pathom Chedi is an important religious site in Nakhon Pathom Province.
        It has a long history dating back to the Dvaravati period.
        During the 11th Buddhist century, ancient Nakhon Pathom was a prosperous maritime trade center,
        with a large square-based circular pagoda called "Maha That Luang" or "Phra Thom."

        In the Ayutthaya period, the ancient city of Nakhon Pathom declined in importance,
        but Phra Thom remained a sacred site for pilgrims.
        In 1831, King Mongkut (Rama IV), while still a monk, visited the great stupa in Nakhon Chaisri
        and called it "Phra Pathom Chedi."

    <string name="point_1_info">Point 1: "The Phra Pathom Chedi is the largest stupa in Thailand. It was originally known as the 'Phra Tham Chedi.' The history of the Phra Pathom Chedi dates back to the Suvarnabhumi period. It is believed to have been constructed during the time when the Buddhist missionaries of King Ashoka of India traveled to spread Buddhism to Suvarnabhumi. The Phra Pathom Chedi is a large stupa with an inverted bell shape. Its original structure was made of wooden logs, bound together with large chains, and built with bricks. It was later restored for the first time by King Rama IV (King Mongkut) while he was still a monk. During his pilgrimage, he encountered the Phra Pathom Chedi, which was in a dilapidated and deteriorating state."</string>
